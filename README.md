# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA

As part of our Value-Added Course with UNP Education, we conducted a Power BI-based financial data analysis to uncover key business insights. Our study focused on analyzing sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, the impact of discounts, and product performance. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s advanced data visualization and analytical capabilities, we identified critical patterns and proposed strategic solutions to enhance business operations.

Key Insights & Findings:

Observed a 249.46% increase in profit, driven by higher sales, pricing adjustments, and shifts in demand.

Identified regional profit margin disparities, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies to improve profitability.

Assessed the impact of discounts, finding that while they boosted sales, excessive discounting on certain products led to profit erosion.

Analyzed product margins, revealing that strong sales of low-margin products negatively affected overall profitability, whereas high-margin products significantly contributed to business growth.

Strategic Recommendations:

Optimize pricing strategies through dynamic and value-based pricing.

Develop a structured discounting approach to maintain a balance between sales growth and profitability.

Improve inventory management using demand forecasting to prevent overstocking and stockouts.

Expand sales initiatives in high-growth regions to maximize market opportunities.
