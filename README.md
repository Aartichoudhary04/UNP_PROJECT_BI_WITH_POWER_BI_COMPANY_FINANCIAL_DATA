# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIAL_DATA

As part of a value-added course with UNP Education, I leveraged Power BI to analyze a company's financial dataset. My analysis provided key insights into sales performance, profit trends, regional profitability, discount effects, and product performance. The findings highlight a 249.46% profit growth, regional profit margin variations, and the influence of high and low-margin products. Based on these insights, I recommended strategies to optimize pricing, discounts, inventory management, and sales expansion for sustained business growth.
